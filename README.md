# Affine Cipher (Case-Sensitive)
A simple Python script to encrypt and decrypt text using the **Affine Cipher** method.
This script supports both uppercase and lowercase letters, preserves non-alphabetic characters, and allows the user to input plaintext and keys directly.

## Features
- User-defined keys `(a, b)` with validation (`a` must be coprime with 26).
- Case-sensitive encryption and decryption (keeps uppercase and lowercase).
- Non-alphabetic characters are preserved as-is.
- Interactive user input for plaintext and keys.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required.
