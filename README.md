# Affine Cipher
A simple Python script to encrypt and decrypt text using the **Affine Cipher** method.
This script supports both uppercase and lowercase letters, preserves non-alphabetic characters, and allows the user to input plaintext and keys directly.

- Interactive user input for plaintext and keys.
- Displays step-by-step calculation during encryption and decryption.
